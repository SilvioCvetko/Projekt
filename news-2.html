In France, crêpes are thin, delicate pancakes typically filled with sweet or savory fillings such as Nutella, cheese, or fruit. In Japan, dorayaki are sweet, fluffy pancakes filled with sweet red bean paste, popularized by the beloved character Doraemon.</p>
                <p>In Scandinavia, æbleskiver are spherical pancakes cooked in a special cast-iron pan and often served with jam or powdered sugar. Meanwhile, in India, dosas are thin, crispy pancakes made from fermented rice and lentil batter, enjoyed with chutney and sambar.</p>
                <p>In recent years, pancakes have experienced a resurgence in popularity, fueled by creative chefs and food enthusiasts eager to put their own spin on this classic dish.
